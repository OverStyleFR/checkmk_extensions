# Checkmk Monitoring Compliance
# Agent-based check plug-in (Check API v2)
#
# Determines, per host, which subsystems are installed/running but NOT yet
# monitored, even though Checkmk would be able to monitor them.
#
#   - WARN: present but not running, not monitored
#   - CRIT: present and running,     not monitored
#
# Detection is no longer based on a static application list. Instead every
# data source contributes typed "capabilities" (type + name). Capabilities are
# correlated to the check plug-ins available on the site (by a normalized name
# token + alias table), so any program whose name matches an available plug-in
# is detected automatically. All capabilities are additionally written to a
# persistent, deduplicated Capability Database that grows over time.
#
# Detection sources:
#   1. Existing agent sections   -> which of the consumed sections are present
#   2. systemd units             -> via agent plug-in / built-in section
#   3. Processes (ps / ps_lnx)   -> running programs
#   4. Host labels               -> via the special agent (Livestatus)
#   5. HW/SW inventory packages  -> via the special agent (inventory tree)
#   + installed packages         -> lnx_packages / win_reg_uninstall / agent

# Some subsystems are kernel/library features rather than a running service:
# the package (and any always-on boot hook units, see
# SYSTEMD_ALWAYS_ON_UNITS below) can be present on virtually every host of a
# distro family without the feature ever being *used*. For these tokens,
# package/inventory presence alone is not treated as evidence of actual use;
# we additionally require corroborating evidence from the already-collected
# "df" section (mounted filesystems), which every host reports anyway - no
# extra agent plug-in needed. If that evidence is missing, the capability is
# dropped entirely (not just downgraded), matching what a human investigating
# the host would conclude ("installed but never touched").
# "mssql" is included here too, but with a different rationale: unlike the
# storage/cluster features above, a real SQL Server *engine* install is a
# legitimate WARN ("present, not running") even while stopped - the problem
# is that *installed-only* evidence for "mssql" keeps coming from packages
# that are not the engine at all (SQL Server Compact, ODBC/OLE DB drivers,
# SSMS, ...; see EVIDENCE_EXCLUDE) and new client-only package name variants
# keep showing up faster than they can be excluded one by one. Requiring the
# Windows "services" section to show an actual "MSSQL*"-prefixed service
# (running or not) as corroboration - see _usage_evidence() below -
# means only real Microsoft SQL Server engine installs (which always
# register such a service, even when stopped) can ever trigger this
# recommendation at all, independent of how creatively named some bundled
# driver/tool package turns out to be.

    The raw section lists every unit systemd knows about, which includes a

      - "not-found" units (LOAD=not-found): pure ghost references pulled in
        via another unit's Wants=/After=, the software itself was never
        installed (e.g. a stray "postfix.service" on a host without mail
        server, or "nfs-server.service" without NFS installed).
      - "masked" units (LOAD=masked): explicitly disabled, cannot run.
      - Template units without an instance (name ends in "@", e.g.
        "openvpn@.service", "zfs-mount@.service"): these can never be
        active themselves, only concrete instances like "openvpn@foo" can.

    LOAD=loaded + ACTIVE=active is the correct signal regardless of the
    low-level SUB state: boot-time oneshot units for real, in-use software
    correctly settle into "active exited" (e.g. zfs-mount.service,
    zfs-share.service on a host with an imported zpool) just like
    long-running daemons show "active running" (e.g. zfs-zed.service).
    ENABLED status (enabled/disabled/static/generated) says nothing about

    """Derive real-usage evidence for kernel/storage features from
    already-collected agent sections - no extra agent plug-in required.

    - "zfs":  any mounted filesystem has fs_type == "zfs" in the "df" section,
              OR the "zfsget" section (checkmk's own zfs list parser) has at
              least one parsed dataset. The df route alone is not reliable
              here: on some hosts (observed on Proxmox VE with a ZFS root
              pool) the agent's df output omits ZFS-backed mounts entirely,
              even though ZFS is actively used - zfsget is the direct,
              ZFS-native usage signal for that case.
    - "lvm":  any mounted filesystem's device is an LVM-managed block device,
              i.e. /dev/mapper/<vg>-<lv> or /dev/dm-<N> (the device naming
              the kernel itself uses for active LVM logical volumes).
    - "corosync": the corosync.service systemd unit is actually loaded+active
              right now (see _systemd_units()). The corosync *package* alone
              is not evidence of cluster usage - on Proxmox VE it is a
              standard dependency pulled in on every install, clustered or
              not, so the package being present says nothing about whether
              this host is part of a cluster.
    - "dmraid": the "md" section (kernel /proc/mdstat, parsed by checkmk's
              built-in "md" agent section) reports at least one actual
              array. The dmraid *package* alone is not evidence of an
              active software RAID - on openSUSE it ships pre-installed
              on virtually every install regardless of whether any disk
              set is actually configured as a RAID.
    - "mssql": the built-in Windows "services" section (WinService entries)
              contains a service whose name/description matches
              MSSQL.*running (i.e. a "MSSQL$<instance>"/"MSSQLSERVER" service
              that is actually running right now). This is deliberately
              stricter than the other tokens above (which accept mere
              presence of a feature): only a *running* SQL Server engine
              service is accepted as corroboration, so package-only hits
              (SQL Server Compact, ODBC/OLE DB drivers, SSMS, ...) can never
              trigger the "Deploy mssql.vbs" recommendation, matching what a
              human checking "is SQL Server actually running here?" would
              look for first.
    - "iis":  the built-in Windows "services" section contains the actual
              web-serving engine service ("W3SVC" / "World Wide Web
              Publishing Service") in a running state. Deliberately NOT
              satisfied by other IIS-branded management/admin services such
              as "IIS-Verwaltungsdienst" (WMSVC, the remote IIS Manager
              service) - that service can be running/installed while the
              web-serving engine itself is stopped or not installed at all,
              which would otherwise wrongly suggest deploying the IIS
              application-pool plug-in on a host that never actually serves
              anything via IIS.
