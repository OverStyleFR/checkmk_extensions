# Proxmox Backup Server (REST API)

Checkmk special agent + check plugins that monitor a
[Proxmox Backup Server](https://www.proxmox.com/en/proxmox-backup-server) (PBS)
through its REST API (default port 8007, API-token authentication).
Not meant as a replacement for monitoring via the Checkmk agent, but as an addition.

## What it monitors

One host runs the special agent against the PBS API; services are auto-discovered:

| Service | Description |
|---|---|
| `PBS Node` | CPU utilization, load average, uptime |
| `PBS Node Memory` | RAM and swap usage |
| `PBS Node Root FS` | Root filesystem usage |
| `PBS Subscription` | Subscription/support status |
| `PBS Datastore <name>` | Per-datastore usage + PBS estimated-full projection (one per datastore) |
| `PBS GC <datastore>` | Garbage collection: schedule, last result, last runtime, reclaimed space, bad chunks (one per datastore) |
| `PBS Job <type> <id>` | Configured prune / verify / sync / tape jobs, each with its last run result (one per job) |
| `PBS Backup Age <datastore>[, Namespace: <ns>]` | Freshness of backups: age of the newest snapshot per backup group (VM/CT/host), one service per datastore and per datastore+namespace |

## Requirements

- Checkmk 2.3.0b1 or newer (uses the `cmk_addons_plugins` API v2 layout).
- A PBS User **AND** API token with Roles `Audit` and also `RemoteAudit`, if sync jobs should be monitored as well.
  Both on path `/` and with propagation set to yes. See screenshot below.
  Create them under
  **Configuration > Access Control > API Token** in the PBS UI.
  Then add the token and it's permission under **Configuration > Access Control > Permissions**

## Installation

```sh
mkp add proxmox_backup_server_api-1.1.7.mkp
mkp enable proxmox_backup_server_api 1.1.7
```

Then in Checkmk:

1. Create a host for the PBS server.
2. Add the rule **Setup > Agents > Other integrations > Proxmox Backup Server (REST API)**.
3. Enter the API token ID and token secret (the secret may reference the
   password store), adjust port / node name / TLS check as needed.
4. Run service discovery and activate changes.

## Configuration options (WATO ruleset)

- **API token ID** — e.g. `root@pam!checkmk`
- **API token secret** — supports the Checkmk password store
- **HTTPS port** — default `8007`
- **PBS node name** — default `localhost` (single-node installs)
- **Task history scan depth** — how many recent tasks to correlate job/GC results from
- **Disable TLS certificate verification** — for self-signed certs (default on)
- **Request timeout**

### Backup Age (Freshness) check parameters

The `PBS Backup Age` service has its own two rulesets:

- **PBS backup age discovery** — which datastores are discovered (all / regex /
  explicit list) and whether per-namespace services are created.
- **PBS backup age** (check parameters):
  - **Warning / Critical age** — thresholds for the newest snapshot per group
    (default 2 / 10 days). Groups that trip a threshold are named with their age
    in the summary, e.g. `2 backups older than 10 days: vm/307 (291d), vm/100 (15d)`.
  - **Do not raise alerts** — report-only mode (state stays OK).
  - **Ignore backups older than** — backups older than this are treated as
    abandoned and no longer alert. They remain visible in the service details
    flagged with `(ignored by rule)`, but do not affect the state or summary.
  - **Ignore these groups** — exclude individual groups entirely (neither counted
    nor shown). Accepts one regular expression per line, matched against the group
    key with the usual Checkmk infix behaviour (`vm/` for all VMs,
    `vm/(9000|9001)` for a set, `^ct/300$` for exactly one).

## Changelog

- **1.1.7** — Fixed a false `CRIT` on the `PBS Datastore` check: PBS does not
  clear or recompute `estimated_full_date` once a growth trend flattens or
  reverses (e.g. after pruning), so a past timestamp could be stale forecast
  data rather than a genuine near-capacity warning. A past
  `estimated_full_date` is now reported as `OK` with an informational notice
  instead of forcing a critical state; real capacity thresholds on
  used/total/avail are unaffected.
- **1.1.6** — Fixed a `cmk-validate-plugins` error: `check_default_parameters`
  for `proxmox_backup_server_api_node/_memory/_rootfs/_datastore` used the old
  bare tuple format (`(80.0, 90.0)`) instead of the `SimpleLevels`-expected
  `('fixed', (80.0, 90.0))` shape, and `proxmox_backup_server_api_snapshots`
  shipped a stray `ignore_old_errors: None` default that isn't a valid
  `TimeSpan` value. Also fixed `full_horizon_days` in the datastore check to
  go through the same `SimpleLevels`-safe unpacking as the other levels.
