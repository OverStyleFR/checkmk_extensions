| Package    | Description                                                        |
|------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------|
| [`opnsense`](opnsense/) | OPNsense firewall monitoring via the REST API — firmware/update status, per-service, system/uptime/load, memory/swap, per-filesystem. |
| [`pmg`](pmg/) | Proxmox Mail Gateway monitoring via the REST API (ticket auth) — mail throughput/junk ratio, SMTP early rejects, per-queue Postfix depth, spam/virus quarantine size, ClamAV DB freshness, SpamAssassin rule updates, node status, pending package updates, subscription status, and per-certificate expiry. |
| [`proxmox_backup_server_api`](proxmox_backup_server_api/) | Proxmox Backup Server monitoring via the REST API — node CPU/load/memory/uptime/root FS, subscription, per-datastore usage with estimated-full projection, garbage collection, and configured prune/verify/sync/tape jobs. |
| [`proxmox_node_swap`](proxmox_node_swap/) | Proxmox VE node swap usage (agent-based + Agent-Bakery): monitors host swap consumption and pinpoints the QEMU VMs/LXC containers responsible, with configurable warn/crit levels and graphing. |
| [`powerdns`](powerdns/) | PowerDNS Authoritative Server and Recursor monitoring via their built-in HTTP APIs (control-socket fallback) — status/security-status, query & error rates, packet/query/record cache efficiency, answer latency, per-zone record counts & serials, and recursor DNSSEC validation. Ships an agent plugin + CEE agent-bakery rule. |
| [`dnssec_health`](dnssec_health/) | DNSSEC status monitoring for arbitrary domains via a stdlib special agent (no agent on host, no `dnspython`) — checks every configured domain against every configured resolver, reporting whether it's signed (`DNSKEY`) and validated (`AD` bit). |
| [`mail_domain_health`](mail_domain_health/) | ⚠️ **WIP** — DNS-based mail-domain security posture via a stdlib special agent (no agent on host): SPF, DMARC, DKIM, DNSBL/RBL, domain blacklists, MTA-STS/TLS-RPT, DANE/TLSA, BIMI and RDAP registration expiry, plus an overview dashboard. Incompatible changes expected. |
| [`openwb`](openwb/) | ⚠️ **WIP** — openWB wallbox monitoring via its read-only simpleAPI HTTP endpoint (auto-discovers chargepoints, counters, batteries, PV) — charging power/state, grid import/export, battery SoC, PV yield. |
| [`homeassistant`](homeassistant/) | Home Assistant special agent — reads sensor states via the REST API and area/device metadata via the WebSocket API, groups entities by area into piggyback hosts (`ha-<area>`), with configurable domain filters and safety limits on generated hosts/entities. |
| [`zfs_arc`](zfs_arc/) | ZFS ARC cache usage (agent-based + Agent-Bakery): monitors ARC size vs. `zfs_arc_max` and RAM, and hit ratio, with independently configurable warn/crit levels, an unconditional throttle-event warning, a heuristic tuning suggestion and graphing. |
| [`hermes_dashboard`](hermes_dashboard/) | [Hermes Agent](https://hermes-agent.nousresearch.com/) web dashboard monitoring via its REST API (`GET /api/status`) — overall status, gateway process state, per-platform connection status (Telegram/Discord/Slack/...), per-component health (gateway/dashboard/storage/platforms), active sessions, and pending updates. |
